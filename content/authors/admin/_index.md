I am currently a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with [Prof. Mike Love](mikelove.github.io) in Biostatistics and [Prof. Melissa Troester](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/melissa-troester-phd/) in Epidemiology. I am a recipient of the [UNC Center of Environment Health and Susceptibility](https://sph.unc.edu/cehs/center-for-environmental-health-and-susceptibility/) Training Grant and previously the Susan G. Komen Graduate Training Fellowship in Breast Cancer Disparities. 

Mainly, I develop statistical methods for genetic association and epidemiological studies and implement them to understand how biological heterogeneity influences disparities in health outcomes in cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. During my graduate work, I have closely collaborated with [Prof. Hudson Santos](https://nursing.unc.edu/people/hudson-santos/) and [Prof. Rebecca Fry](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/rebecca-fry-phd/) at the [Institute for Environmental Health Solutions](https://sph.unc.edu/iehs/institute-for-environmental-health-solutions/) to study the importance of placental genetic and epigenetic variation in the risk of autism spectrum disorder and other neuropsychiatric developmental disorders from a multiomic perspective.
I graduated in 2015 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. in Mathematical decision sciences. As an undergraduate, I was awarded the Mackenzie Family Foundation Innovation Scholarship, a four-year, full scholarship given to only two students applying to UNC-Chapel Hill every year.
